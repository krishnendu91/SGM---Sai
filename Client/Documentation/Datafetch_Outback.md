# Code Documentation for Datafetch from Outback Inverter

This Python script is designed for collecting data from Outback 9kW Inverters and Charge Controllers and publishing it using MQTT. 
The script retrieves data from Outback Inverters and Charge Controllers, processes it, and inserts it into a MySQL database. It also publishes the data via MQTT for further processing or visualization.

## Dependencies
- The code relies on several Python libraries, including `datetime`, `time`, `pymysql`, `json`, `mqttservice`, `subprocess`, and `urlopen` from `urllib.request`.

## Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that you have all the required Python libraries installed.
2. Configure the MQTT broker IP address and port in the `mqttservice.mqtt_publish` function calls.
3. Configure the MySQL database connection details in the `pymysql.connect` function calls.
4. Customize the code to match your specific project requirements, including the device type and the data you want to collect.
5. Run the script to collect data from the Inverters and Charge Controllers, insert it into the database, and publish it via MQTT.

Make sure to adapt the code to your project's hardware setup and data collection needs.
